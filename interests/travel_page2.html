        <p><strong>Country:</strong> Morrocco</p>
        <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 1 week</p>
        <p><strong>About my Time:</strong> During the Christmas break I travelled
        to Morrocco with the UCC Surf Club on their annual trip away. 
        Morrocco is a very different place to Ireland, one most noticeable difference
        is the weather (Much Hotter!!!). During the week we went surfing every day 
        and spent lots of our time their at the beach. I would definetly like to 
        visit Morrocco again sometime in the future. The food was also quite nice
        as well during our time.</p>
